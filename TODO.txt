1. Server creates named, pending socket

2. Client creates same socket

3. Socket Handshake Compilation* happens
   (If a client closes a socket, that socket uncompiles
    with the server's side. This allows selective cleanup^)

4. When a socket closes on one endpoint, all other endpoints connected to that
   socket close, uncompile, and cleanup. By automatically closing, writes panic
   and reads block forever; these should be delt with correctly.
   (Only uncompile if all sockets are closed under that name.)

5. Combine keys, separated by separators.



*Socket Handshake Compilation is when two sockets with complementary directions
 and the same name agree from that point on to send data between each other

^Socket closing, uncompiling, and cleanup have two variations: client & server.
 The server is unique in that it splinters its one socket into one fewer
 compilations of that socket due to the client's side closing, uncompiling, and
 cleaning up.
